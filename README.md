# Game Station

Hello, greetings from GameStaion:

* clone the repo into your local computer.
* Make sure you have installed the latest version of node js and npm.
* Open the terminal and change the directory into the repo and run ```npm install```. It will install all the dependencies for the app.
* When done, run the server by running the command ```sudo node server.js```. The server will run locally on port 80.
* Open your favorite web-browser (not preferably Internet Explorer) and enter 127.0.0.1 in URL. 
* Now you are ready to enjoy our multiplayer games.

If you have multiple devices connected to your local network, you can connect to the server by typing the server machine's IP address in your browser.

##### Note - Our app performs and fits well in desktop devices.
